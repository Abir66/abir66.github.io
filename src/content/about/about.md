I am a final year student from **Department of CSE at BUET**. My university life has been a well-balanced blend of academics and extracurricular activities. I am a passionate problem solver. I love solving complex problems and break them down to simple tasks.

I have a strong passion for learning new things and others say I tend to catch new things very fast. I am also a good team player. Being part of teams I participated and won several programming and development related competitions like **GameJams, CTFs, Deep learning and Programming Contests**.

In addition to my academic pursuits, Iâ€™ve been actively involved in extracurricular activities. I currently serve as the **President** of **BUET Cyber Security Club**. In my sophomore, junior years I have voulenteered as a Graphics Designer at **IEEE Computer Society BUET Student Branch Chapter**. I later took on the role of Technical Committee Chair where I helped organize several successful events.

I love Travelling. I have explored several beautiful destinations in Bangladesh and India, with plans to travel to Nepal, AnnaPurna Base Camp and Japan in the near future. One of my bucket list goals is to visit **40 countries before I turn 40**. My other hobbies include photography, table tennis, cycling and anime.
